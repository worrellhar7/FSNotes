Appreciate the patience while i worked on this update. Thanks to pledgers, testers and all FSNotes community, love you all guys.

This is biggest update in FSNotes history, so i have some news:

## Polished iCloud Drive sync

Yep! Now more stable. Fixed bug with data missing ðŸ˜±

New folder appears in sidebar without app restarting. 

4.0 fixes crashes related to notes import.

## User interface

New generation of iPhones with notches supports properly now ðŸ¥³

Main controller completely reimplemented with parallax effect. Sidebar opens with flawless animation.

New notes and projects adds/removes without tables reloading.

## App speedup

The new caching system allows you to launch the application very quick.

I have almost 10000 notes and this pretty fast. Projects selection and search speed improved too.

## True dark mode

The app uses true, hex black â€” #000000 â€” for the majority of the dark theme. 

This is really good news for iPhones with OLED displays.

## Preview mode

FSNotes 4.0 adds new preview mode, that always on. Off course, you can make always off in one tap. Just double tap for edit note or click appropriate icon in navigation bar.

Added full screen in landscape.

In preview, you even can mark checkboxes ðŸ”¥

## Handoff

This is a new feature that i use regularly on iOS and macOS. 

Open note in FSNotes on iPhone and continue your task on MacBook in one click.

## Auto renaming

Now you can choose in settings â€” use UUID for files naming or auto rename files by title from first line.

## Projects and tags managements

In FSNotes 4.0 you can easily manage your folders and tags.

Create, rename and delete folders and tags in a couple of tap. Just long press item in sidebar or tap on project/tag title in navigation bar.

## Wikilinks

Now you can link one document to another easily. Look for the document icon in the editor toolbar.

## Fin

Thanks for choosing FSNotes.
