### MermaidJS allows you to include diagrams in your note

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Alice
    participant Bob
    Alice->>John: Hello John, how are you?
    loop Healthcheck
        John->>John: Fight against hypochondria
    end
    Note right of John: Rational thoughts <br/>prevail!
    John-->>Alice: Great!
    John->>Bob: How about you?
    Bob-->>John: Jolly good!
```

### And MathJax allows you to include mathematics

Documentation: https://www.mathjax.org

When $a \ne 0$, there are two solutions to \\(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\\) and they are
$$x = {-b \pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac} \over 2a}.$$

## Containers

Personally i recommend TextBundle containers , FSNotes implements it fully, so go to Settings -> Default container and check "textbundle".

You can read spec here: http://textbundle.org/
